# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. Our job is processing the dataset based on Martha’s requirements and analyze it to discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in new cryptocurrencies. 

Since the raw data is not ideal, we will clean it by dropping the null values and any unnecessary columns. Then apply principal component analysis to reduce the cleaned data only into three dimensions. Finally we choose the unsupervised machine learning – Kmeans to train and predict the data, and come out with visualizations for better demonstration.
